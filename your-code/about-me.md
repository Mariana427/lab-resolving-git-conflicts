Hi guys! My name is Mariana and I came from Porto city. I complete my master in Marine Biology last year and now I'm looking for my next challenge. 
I came to Ironhack because I always wanted to learn how to program and I decide that this was the best time for that. At the end of this course I expect to understand more about how to resolve problems and work with large amounts of data.

Honestly I don't have a clear ideia of here I see myself after this. I think I can imagine myself more on a problem solving environment.
